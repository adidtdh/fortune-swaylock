# fortune-swaylock
### A simple bash script that makes swaylock look a bit nicer

This script creates a lock screen each time when activated, which has a
different quote each time, which is done by using `fortune`. Slightly modified to work on wayland with sway.

When the lock screen comes up just type your password and hit enter, nothing
will come up while you are typing the password unless you remove the -u flag
from i3lock in the script

Dependencies:
* imagemagick
* grim
* swaylock
* fortune

### Customization

[Material Design based](https://material.io/icons/#ic_lock) (and easily colorable) icon added by [RanzQ](https://github.com/RanzQ) (CC BY).

For custom color, change the fill of the svg circle (`md-lock-icon.svg` line 42) and convert it to png ([inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) is useful).

Font here is `RobotoCondensed-Bold` from `fonts-roboto` and for transparent colors use `rgba()` (eg. `gradientColor='rgba(0,160,0,0.5)'`).
